Evolutionary Strategies (ES) are optimization algorithms that focus on directly searching for
optimal solutions without explicitly defining an objective function.
ES techniques explore the search space by using mutation and recombination operators to generate new candidate solutions.
The fitness of each solution is assessed through a fitness assignment mechanism,
such as comparing the solutions against each other or using surrogate models.
The goal is to guide the algorithm towards solutions that are considered better within the population,
without relying on a predefined objective function.
